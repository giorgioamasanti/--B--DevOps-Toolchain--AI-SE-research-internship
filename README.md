# Tetris8

Tetris8 is a classic Tetris game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Players can control falling tetromino pieces in a grid-based playing field, utilizing keyboard inputs to maneuver and rotate the pieces while avoiding collisions.

## Overview

The architecture of Tetris8 consists of a main game loop that manages user input, updates the game state, and renders the grid and tetrominoes. The project is structured around a Grid class that handles the grid state and collision detection, and a Tetromino class that represents the various tetromino shapes and their movements. The game is built using Python and the Pygame library, emphasizing modular design for future feature expansions.

The project files are organized as follows:
- `main.py`: The main entry point for the game, responsible for initializing the game environment and running the game loop.
- `grid.py`: Contains the Grid class, managing the game grid and its state.
- `tetromino.py`: Defines the Tetromino class, representing the shapes and colors of tetrominoes.
- `tetris_game.py`: Implements the TetrisGame class, which integrates the grid and tetromino functionalities, handling game logic and rendering.
- `Tests/`: A directory containing unit and integration tests for various components of the game.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the external dependencies required for the project.

## Features

- **Grid Creation**: A 10x20 grid where tetrominoes can move and interact.
- **Tetromino Types**: Includes seven tetromino shapes (I, O, T, J, L, S, Z), each represented by distinct colors.
- **Tetromino Movement**: Players can control tetrominoes using keyboard inputs (arrow keys for movement and rotation).
- **Random Tetromino Generation**: At the start of each game, a random tetromino spawns at the top of the grid.
- **Row Clearing**: Automatically clears filled rows and updates the score.
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when a new tetromino cannot be placed due to collisions.
- **High Score Tracking**: Displays the current session's high scores with timestamps.
- **Sound Effects and Music**: Background music and sound effects for actions like placing tetrominoes and clearing rows.
- **Level Up Mechanism**: The game speeds up as the score increases, adding to the challenge.

## Getting started

### Requirements

To run Tetris8, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pygame library

You can install the required Python packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tetris8
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Use the arrow keys to control the tetrominoes:
   - Left Arrow: Move left
   - Right Arrow: Move right
   - Down Arrow: Move down
   - Up Arrow: Rotate (anticlockwise)
   - M: Toggle background music
   - S: Toggle sound effects
